      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am a mathematics and computer science enthusiast currently working on the Algorithms and Optimization team at <a href="https://www.rideco.com">RideCo</a>, a Sofware as a Service company providing dynamic transit ridesharing solutions. In 2017 I graduated from Mount Allison University in Sackville New Brunswick with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science and a minor in Philosophy. I went on to complete a Master's of Mathematics in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, and completed my thesis and my degree in December 2018.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Competitive Programming</h3>
      <p>I have been volunteering my time as a judge for several ICPC and ICPC-style contests since 2018. I write sample solutions to programming challenges (a.k.a., problems), contribute test data to problems, and provide feedback on wording. I have contributed several problems of my own. A list of the problems that I have authored can be found here: <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problem-authors/Finn%20Lidbetter">https://open.kattis.com/problem-authors/Finn%20Lidbetter</a>.</p>
      <p>I have helped prepare the Atlantic Canadian Preliminary Contest, the <a href="https://mapscontest.com">Mount Allison Programming Showdown (MAPS)</a>, the Northeast North America ICPC contetest, The North American Divisional Contest, and the North American Championship. I have worked as the chief judge for the Northeast North America ICPC region since 2020.</p>
      <h3>Bragging rights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number">Erdo&#779;s number</a> is 2 via <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-98654-8_10">Additive Number Theory via Approximation by Regular Languages</a> (Bell, Lidbetter, Shallit) and <a href="http://archive.numdam.org/item/JTNB_1991__3_1_43_0/">New Bounds on the Length of Finite Pierce and Engel Series</a> (Erdo&#779;s, Shallit). Or alternatively via <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-98654-8_19">Counting Subwords and Regular Languages</a> (Colbourn, Dougherty, Lidbetter, Shallit) and <a href="https://www.emis.de/classics/Erdos/cit/62205042.htm">A Conjecture on Dominating Cycles</a> (Clark, Colbourn, Erdo&#779;s).</li>
        <li>I participated in the 2017 ICPC World Finals, in Rapid City, South Dakota, USA, as a member of the Mount Allison University ICPC team. To qualify for this competition we beat Harvard University (<a href="NENA_scoreboard.png">scoreboard</a>). For reference, Mount Allison University had only 6 computer science major graduates in 2017, three of which were <a href="WorldFinalsTeam.jpg">me and my two ICPC teammates</a>.</li>
        <li>I scored 28/120 in the 2016 Putnam Contest. This placed me in the 88th percentile of participants that year, a collection of north american students that all enjoy mathematics enough to decide to participate in the contest. The median score in 2016 was 1/120.</li>
