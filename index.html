      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am a mathematics and computer science enthusiast currently working on the Algorithms and Optimization team at <a href="https://www.rideco.com">RideCo</a>, a Sofware as a Service company providing dynamic transit ridesharing solutions. In 2017 graduated from Mount Allison University in Sackville New Brunswick with a first class joint honours in Mathematics and Computer Science with distinction and a minor in Philosophy. I went on to complete a Master's of Mathematics in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, and completed my degree in December 2018.</p>
      <h3>Publications</h3>
      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>I enjoy a wide range of hobbies including playing piano, curling and skiing in the winter, rock climbing, woodworking, and competitive programming.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some piano recordings that I hope to improve upon some day soon: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC35p0l-zWZ5N0uYtD0zbbpg">youtube.com/finnlidbetter</a></li>
        <li>Woodworking projects: <a href="PenroseTiling.jpg">Penrose Tiling</a> (technically it is a quasicrystal and not a Penrose tiling as I broke the matching rules in a few places), bedside table.</li>
        <li>Other crafty project: <a href="HilbertCurveBanner.jpg">Hilbert Curve Banner</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Competitive Programming</h3>
      <p>I still like to participate and contribute to competitive programming competitions. This includes the annual Google CodeJam (best finish 1004th in 2018) and Facebook Hackercup (best finish 337th in 2018) contests, and the regular online rounds hosted on <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/finnlidbetter">Codeforces</a> and <a href="https://atcoder.jp/users/FinnLidbetter">AtCoder.jp</a>.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>Bragging rights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number">Erdo&#779;s number</a> is 2 via <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-98654-8_10">Additive Number Theory via Approximation by Regular Languages</a> (Bell, Lidbetter, Shallit) and <a href=http://archive.numdam.org/item/JTNB_1991__3_1_43_0/"">New Bounds on the Length of Finite Pierce and Engel Series</a> (Erd&#779;s, Shallit). Or alternatively via <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-98654-8_19">Counting Subwords and Regular Languages</a> (Colbourn, Dougherty, Lidbetter, Shallit) and <a href="https://www.emis.de/classics/Erdos/cit/62205042.htm"></a> (Clark, Colbourn, Erd&#779;s).</li>
        <li>I participated in the 2017 ICPC World Finals, in Rapid City, South Dakota, USA, as a member of the Mount Allison University ICPC team. To qualify for this competition we beat Harvard University (<a href="NENA_scoreboard.png">scoreboard</a>). For reference, Mount Allison University had only 6 computer science major graduates in 2017, three of which were <a href="WorldFinalsTeam.jpg">me and my two ICPC teammates</a>.</li>
        <li>I scored 28/120 in the 2016 Putnam Contest. This placed by in the 88th percentile of participants that year, a collection of north american students that all enjoy mathematics enough to decide to participate in the contest. The median score in 2016 was 1/120.</li>
